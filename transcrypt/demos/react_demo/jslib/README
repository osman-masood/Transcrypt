WIP. Currently doesn't work.
Meant to put JS libraries (jQuery, React etc) transpiled into Python, so that Python code
can use them with autocompletion, & so IDEs won't show errors/warnings.

HOW TO USE:

> js2py.translate_file('react-dom.js', 'react_dom.py')

> js2py.translate_file('react-with-addons.js', 'react_with_addons.py')

However, above code throws errors. Also tried jiphy, doesn't work either.
